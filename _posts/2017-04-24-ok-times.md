An okayish way to practice the times table, with questions ranging from 2 to 12.

The background of the game displays a matrix with colors corresponding to your progress and how fast you answered. The default mode uses random values based on weights that bias the randomness towards questions that are, on average, harder. The sequential mode just goes over all values in sequence. To help out, after a few seconds, the correct answer fades in if hints are enabled.

Perhaps the most interesting feature is voice recognition support via the Web Speech API. This feature is currently only available on Google Chrome. It allows both questions to be read via speech synthesis and answers listen via voice recognition. Different languages are supported using Google's speech services.
