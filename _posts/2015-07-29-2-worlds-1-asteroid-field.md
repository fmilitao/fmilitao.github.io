A short experiment of building a lunar lander style game, but with realistic physics. To make the scenario more interesting, there are two opposing worlds: one at the bottom of the screen and the other at the top. Gravity pulls in the direction of the world in which the ship is closest to. In the middle of the screen you get "gravity-free" space and a few asteroids to make things more interesting.

There are no points, score, or any other penalty since crashing will just push objects around rather than make them explode. This project was built just to toy with the idea above, but without any meaningful gameplay goals.
