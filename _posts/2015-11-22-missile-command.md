This project is a web version of a simulation of two motherships fighting each other in space, in opposite corners of the screen. The original code was in Java using Swing. The port to TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas was mostly seamless with the exception of a few features that TypeScript did not have at the time of the port. Still the look and feel of the game remains virtually identical to the Java version. However, the commanders' logic is limited to the random command that shoots missiles in random directions towards the opposing mothership.
