Progressive Web App for writing to a Google Sheet. Uses material-ui react components to have an Android-like look-and-feel. Mostly used to track expenses. Since my Google API key is encrypted, you will not be able to use this project directly. Instead, you should follow the instructions in the README.md to get your own API key and point to your desired Google Sheet.
