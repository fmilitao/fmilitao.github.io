The aim of the game is to get your ship (the red triangle) to hit as many blue circles as possible before the clock runs out and resets your score. Each circle starts small, blue, and with a high point value. As time passes, the circle grows in size, slowly turns green, and loses its point value. Once the circle reaches green it becomes "gue", which slows the ship down rather than explode and grant points.

The goal with this game was to explore the gameplay idea of a _power brake_ in space. When the ship gathers enough momentum, you can _power brake_ to slow down the ship but keeping that kinetic energy stored. Once the _power brake_ is released the ship immediately recovers the stored speed. This enables the ship to quickly manoeuvre without losing much speed. By using the _power brake_ you can zig-zag around tight place very quickly, but it requires some practice to get it right.
